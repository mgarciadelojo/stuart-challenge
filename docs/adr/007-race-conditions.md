# Title: Addressing Concurrency Issues with Transactions

## Context
When designing a system with concurrent access to a database, it's crucial to address potential race conditions and data consistency issues. This document discusses the use of transactions as a strategy to handle concurrency problems in the context of a courier management system.

## Decision
Transactions are an essential tool to manage concurrent database operations and maintain data consistency.
For the purpose of this exercise, I implemented and unit tested a transaction on the `save` method within the `CourierPostgresRepository` class.

Here's how transactions can help in various scenarios:

### Preventing Lost Updates
Suppose you have an update endpoint that modifies a courier's capacity, and concurrently, a read endpoint is fetching the courier's information. Without transactions, there's a risk of a lost update, where the read endpoint retrieves the courier's data before the update is committed, resulting in outdated information being returned. Using a transaction for the update ensures that the read operation waits until the update is completed, preventing lost updates.

### Maintaining Data Integrity
Transactions help maintain data integrity by ensuring that multiple database operations either succeed together or fail together. If there's an error during the update or read operation, the transaction rolls back, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state.

### Deadlocks and Performance
While transactions help with data consistency, they can also introduce potential performance bottlenecks and deadlocks, especially in high-concurrency scenarios. Deadlocks can occur when multiple transactions contend for the same resources. It's crucial to monitor and optimize your database and application to minimize the likelihood of deadlocks.

### Isolation Levels
PostgreSQL and most relational databases provide different isolation levels for transactions (e.g., Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable). The chosen isolation level can impact the behavior of concurrent transactions. You should choose an appropriate isolation level based on your specific requirements and trade-offs.

### Optimistic Concurrency Control
In some scenarios, you might prefer using optimistic concurrency control mechanisms, such as adding a version field to your database records. With optimistic concurrency control, you can detect and handle conflicts without using explicit transactions. This approach might be suitable for cases where conflicts are infrequent.

### Testing and Load Testing
To ensure that your transaction handling effectively prevents race conditions and maintains data consistency, conduct thorough testing, including load testing with simulated concurrent requests.

## Consequences
In summary, while using transactions can help mitigate certain race conditions and maintain data consistency in a concurrent environment, it's essential to carefully design your database schema, choose the appropriate isolation level, and handle errors gracefully. Additionally, consider using other concurrency control mechanisms when they align better with your application's requirements and performance considerations.
